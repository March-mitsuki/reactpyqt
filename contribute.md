# ReactPyQt Contruibuting Guide

Our community is dedicated to building a 'low-barrier' environment for contributions, making it easier to understand the architecture of open-source software and lowering the barriers to participating in open-source development.

Before you get started, please take a look at our [community code of conduct document](./contribute_conduct.md).
